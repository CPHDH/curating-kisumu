#### Special Thanks to:
Eddie Machado - He has done many times more effort on the starter theme Bones than I have on Sepal and Seed.
Michael Karliner - For encouraging me to pursue the idea

From Bones:
Paul Irish & the HTML5 Boilerplate
Yoast for some WP functions & optimization ideas
Andrew Rogers for code optimization
David Dellanave for speed & code optimization
and several other developers. :)

#### Submit Bugs & or Fixes:
I don't really plan to support this much myself, it's more a proof of concept. If someone wants to take it and run with it, by all means.

But if someone does assume the mantle
